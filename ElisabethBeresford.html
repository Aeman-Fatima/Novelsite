	Elisabeth "Liza" Beresford, MBE (6 August 1926 â€“ 24 December 2010) was a British author of children's books, 
	best known for creating The Wombles. Born into a family with many literary connections, she worked as a journalist but struggled for 
	success until she created the Wombles in the late 1960s. The strong theme of recycling was particularly notable, and the Wombles became 
	very popular with children across the world. While Beresford produced many other literary works, the Wombles remained her best known creation.
