	Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 to 28 November 1968) was 
	an English children's writer whose books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copie
	s. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages; her first book, Child Whispers, a 
	24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history
	, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy, Famous Five, Secret Seven, and Adventure series.
