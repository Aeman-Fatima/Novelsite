	Trebizon is a series of school story novels by Anne Digby set in the fictional school of that name. 
	The fourteen novels were published between 1978 and 1994. Like Enid Blyton's much earlier creation, Malory Towers, Trebizon is located in Cornwall.
The novels follow the protagonist Rebecca Mason from when she joins the school in the second form through to the end of her fifth year.
A major theme throughout the series is Rebecca's burgeoning talent for tennis. Other major characters include Rebecca's two best friends,
 Tish Anderson and Susan Murdoch, and her boyfriend Robbie Anderson.

Fresh from a London comprehensive, Rebecca Mason is plunged into life at Trebizon, the famous boarding school for girls. 
Lonely and anxious to prove herself, Rebecca decides to write something for the school magazine. But the piece that appears is not the one she intended a
nd she 
unwittingly triggers a row which rocks the school. It's a good thing Rebecca has some new friends on her side
