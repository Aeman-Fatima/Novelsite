	</div>
		Most of the teachers, students (espacially who have interest in reading novels) find it difficult to search the novels they'd love to read.
	I designed this website to make it easier for the ones who love reading novels. This website is consisted of sorted detail of authors along with their own brief 
	biographical and biblographical introduction and also the introduction of their contained
	novels and other writings.It allows the readers to find out their favorite authors in a harmonious way.<br/>
