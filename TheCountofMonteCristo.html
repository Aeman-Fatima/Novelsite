	The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. 
	It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating 
	ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. Another important work by Dumas, written prior to his work with Maquet was the short novel "Georges", this novel is of particular interest 
	to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas and plot devices later in "The Count of Monte Cristo". <br />
The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of 
Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of 
the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from 
jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. His plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty. 
The book is a story of romance, loyalty, betrayal, vengeance, selfishness, and justice. <br />
The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, "The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and 
immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood."
