Jean Webster (pseudonym for Alice Jane Chandler Webster, July 24, 1876 to June 11, 1916) was an American writer and author of many books including 
Daddy-Long-Legs and Dear Enemy. Her best-known books feature lively and likeable young female protagonists who come of age intellectually, morally,
 and socially, but with enough humor, snappy dialogue, and gently biting social commentary to make her books palatable and enjoyable to contemporary readers.
