	Daniel Gerhard "Dan" Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of thriller fiction who wrote the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code.
	Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period, and feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy 
	theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons (2000), 
	The Da Vinci Code (2003), and Inferno (2013), have been adapted into films.
	Brown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result, 
	have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' 
	himself, and says that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate" and suggests that the 
	book may be used "as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith".
