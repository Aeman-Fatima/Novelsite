	The best place to start is How to Read A Book to gain an understanding of the levels of reading: 
	
	<ul>
 <li>Elementary </li>
  <li>Inspectional </li>
  <li>Analytical </li>
 <li>Syntopical </li>

</ul>
The goal of reading determines how you read.
Reading the latest Danielle Steel novel is not the same as reading Plato. If you're reading for entertainment or information, you're going
 to read a lot differently (and likely different material) than reading  to increase understanding. While many people are proficient in reading for information and entertainment, 
 few improve their ability to read for knowledge.

Before we can improve our reading skills, we need to understand the differences in the reading levels. They are thought of as levels because 
you can’t move to a higher level without a firm understanding of the previous one they are cumulative.

<ul> <li>Elementary Reading </li> </ul>
This is the level of reading taught in our elementary schools.

<ul> <li>Inspectional Reading </li> </ul>
We've been taught that skimming and superficial reading are bad for understanding. That is not necessarily the case. Using these tools 
 effectively can increase understanding. Inspectional reading allows us  to look at the authors blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper  reading experience.
