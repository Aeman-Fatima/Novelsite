	Set in 1625-1628, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to travel to Paris, to join the Musketeers 
	of the Guard. Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he bestfriends the three most formidable 
	musketeers of the age-Athos, Porthos and Aramis and gets involved in affairs of the state and court.
In genre, The Three Musketeers is primarily a historical and adventure novel. However, Dumas also frequently works into the plot various injustices, 
abuses, and absurdities of the old regime, giving the novel an additional political aspect at a time when the debate in France between republicans and 
monarchists was still fierce. The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during the July Monarchy, four years before the French Revolution 
of 1848 violently established the Second Republic. The author's father, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, had been a well-known General in France's Republican army 
during the French Revolutionary Wars.
