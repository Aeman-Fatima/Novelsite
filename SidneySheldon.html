	Sidney Sheldon (February 11, 1917 to January 30, 2007) was an American writer and producer.

He came to prominence in the 1930s, first working on Bro
adway plays and then in motion pictures, notably writing the successful comedy The Bachelor and the Bobby 
Soxer (1947) which earned him an Academy Award. 
He went on to work in television, where his works spanned a 20-year period during which he created The Patty Duke Show (1963–66), I Dream of 
Jeannie (1965–70) and Hart to Hart (1979–84). He became most famous after he turned 50 and began writing best-selling romantic suspense novels, 
such as Master of the Game (1982), The Other Side of Midnight (1973) and Rage of Angels (1980). He is the seventh best selling fiction writer of all time.
